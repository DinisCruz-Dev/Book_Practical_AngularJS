### Notes about current structure

The first version of this book had the chapter order created by the original ‘import from blogger’ (i.e. by publish order). 

In the current version, the posts are split into the following areas: "Using AngularJS", "KarmaJS", "Firebase", "Misc Tricks", "IDEs", "Troubleshooting", "Appendices", which is a filter based on technology. Note that this can change based on reader feedback, so if you think the order should be different, please send your feedback and ideas.

### About the Author

Dinis Cruz is a Developer and Application Security Engineer focused on how to develop secure applications. A key drive is on 'Automating Application Security Knowledge and Workflows' which is the main concept behind the OWASP O2 Platform and Security Innovation's TeamMentor (Dinis is the main developer and architect of both Applications). Current day job is with Security Innovation where Dinis tries to promote openness, quality and sharing as part a core tenet of TeamMentor's application development environment.

After many years (and multiple roles) Dinis is still very active at OWASP, currently leading the O2 Platform project and helping out other projects and initiatives.

After failing to scale his own security knowledge, learned Git, created security vulnerabilities in code published to production servers, delivered training to developers, and building multiple CI (Continuous Integration) environments; Dinis had the epiphany that the key to application security is "Secure Continuous Delivery: Developer’s Immediate Connection to What They’re Creating". This 'Immediate Connection/Feedback' concept is deep rooted in the development of the O2 Platform/TeamMentor, and is something that will keep Dinis busy for many years.
